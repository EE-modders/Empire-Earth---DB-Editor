# Empire-Earth---DB-Editor

An editor for all DB files for the game Empire Earth and the Art of Conquest addon.

With this program you'll be able to edit all values contained in the db files.
You won't need anymore to open these files with an hex editor and do boring conversions hex->int and int->hex.
This program handle everything and can support any db file.
It just needs to know the db file structure, which is partially done thanks to the community (thank you all!!)

It allows the user to edit all unknown values (change them at your own risk or for testing purposes).
Please tell us, when you find some unknown values.
